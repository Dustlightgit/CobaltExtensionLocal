> # This is a fork that allows you to chose a http url as an instance in the plugin which is needed to be able to use http://localhost:9000/
> It is done by removing a simple code in popup.js that checks the url if it contains https:// and if not it will simply write it infront of the inputed url
> 
> That is an unwanted behavior for such use because it makes it imposibble to use htpp:// address
